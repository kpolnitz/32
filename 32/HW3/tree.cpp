/*
    Replace the incorrect implementations of the countIncludes and the order functions below with correct ones that use recursion in a useful way. Except in the code for the split function that we give you below, your solution must not use the keywords while, for, or goto. You must not use global variables or variables declared with the keyword static, and you must not modify the function parameter lists. You must not use any references or pointers as parameters except for the parameters representing arrays and the parameters of the exchange function we provided. If any of the parameters n1, n2, or n is negative, act as if it were zero.

// in the n1 element array a1 in the same order (though not
// necessarily consecutively).  The empty sequence appears in a
// sequence of length n1 in 1 way, even if n1 is 0.
// For example, if a1 is the 7 element array
//	10 50 40 20 50 40 30
// then for this value of a2     the function must return
//	10 20 40			1
//	10 40 30			2
//	20 10 40			0
//	50 40 30			3
